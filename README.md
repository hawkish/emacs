# emacs 

Emacs is this wonderfully extensible editor. This is my configuration file for a better emacs. 

## Installation
I use the emacs mac port from https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport

To install just:

```shell
brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport
```

```shell
brew install emacs-mac
```

```shell
ln -s /usr/local/opt/emacs-mac/Emacs.app /Applications
```

## Absolutely under construction
So sorry for the mess.

I'm *always* adding - or deleting features - as I need them, and my emacs spans two different operating systems, Debian and OSX, but I do *try* to keep things simple. 

You're free to copy and use anything you find useful.
