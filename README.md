# emacs 

Emacs is this wonderfully extensible editor. This is my configuration file for a better emacs. 


## Absolutely under construction
So sorry for the mess.

I'm *always* adding - or deleting features - as I need them, and my emacs spans two different operating systems, Debian and OSX, but I *try* to keep things simple. 

You're free to copy and use anything you find useful.
